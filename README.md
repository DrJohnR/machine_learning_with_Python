# machine_learning_with_Python
Some simple Python notebooks to practice implementing machine learning algorithms.

RF_AB --> Random Forest and Adaptive Boosting

SVM --> Support Vector Machines

FNN --> Feedforward Neural Network (comparing two optimisation algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam)
